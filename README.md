# TRIAC-phase-control
 
Phase control with TRIAC.

In this code, the design and implementation of a phase control using a TRIAC, an opto DIAC and an MCU to manage the power of a 100 ohms load is performed. The trigger pulses for the TRIAC have been generated using a microcontroller. The microcontroller used is the PIC 16F887A. Depending on the delay time between the zone crossing and the gate pulse applied to the TRIAC, the TRIAC is controlled. applied to the TRIAC, the load voltage is controlled. Therefore, the power flow to the load is controlled by delaying the firing angle of the TRIAC. the TRIAC firing angle is controlled by delaying the TRIAC firing angle. 

KEYWORDS: TRIAC, PIC16F887, phase control, MOC3021.
